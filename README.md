# IEMD:malware detection using interpretable deep-learning architecture
this repo is about demo and evaluation on interpreting image-based malware dataset on machine-learning by varities of explaining methods.
## main branch
this branch merged by lester branch, which mainly contributes to all work depicted in the paper.
## git usage
* init your local repo, this allows you to make your personal file folders to become a repo
`git init`
* track the remote rep
`git remote add origin "ssh-address"`
* then you need to add some files (such as code files your write) onto the cache zones

`git commit -m "your messages"`
* then you need to track your newly-built branch locally connected with the remote branch, such as
`git checkout -b [your local newly-built branch] [remote rep]/[branch]`
